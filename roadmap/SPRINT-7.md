# Sprint 7: CI/CD Pipeline Excellence

**Sprint Duration:** 2-3 days  
**Focus:** Automated deployment to Netlify on every push to main branch  
**Principle:** Simplicity over complexity - working pipeline beats perfect architecture

---

## üéØ Sprint Goal

Establish reliable CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys to Netlify after every push to main branch, ensuring production always reflects latest stable code.

---

## üìä Current State Assessment

### Existing Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow exists (`ci.yml`) with quality checks
- ‚úÖ Netlify site connected: productory-powerups.netlify.app  
- ‚úÖ Build scripts functional for all packages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing: Automatic deployment trigger to Netlify
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing: Build status badges and notifications

### Build Commands
- `npm run build:web` - Web dashboard build
- `npm run build:extension` - Chrome extension build  
- `npm run build:shared` - Shared library build
- Quality checks: lint, type-check, format:check

## üöÄ Sprint Deliverables

### 1. Netlify Auto-Deploy Pipeline
**Owner:** DevOps Engineer  
**Deliverable:** GitHub Action that deploys to Netlify on main branch push
- Connect GitHub to Netlify via GitHub App or Deploy Key
- Add deployment step to existing CI workflow
- Ensure environment variables are properly configured
- Test with actual push to main branch

### 2. Build Status Integration  
**Owner:** DevOps Engineer
**Deliverable:** Visible build status and deployment tracking
- Add build status badge to README.md
- Configure deployment notifications (success/failure)
- Set up deployment preview for PRs
- Document deployment process

### 3. Environment Configuration
**Owner:** DevOps Engineer  
**Deliverable:** Proper environment variable management
- Audit all required environment variables
- Configure Netlify environment variables via UI or CLI
- Ensure secrets are never exposed in logs
- Document environment setup for team

### 4. Rollback Strategy
**Owner:** DevOps Engineer
**Deliverable:** Quick rollback capability for failed deployments  
- Configure Netlify deployment locks for production
- Document rollback procedure
- Test rollback with intentional bad deployment
- Create emergency response checklist

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

1. **Automatic Deployment**: Push to main ‚Üí Netlify deployment within 5 minutes
2. **Build Reliability**: 0 false positives in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Visibility**: Build status visible in GitHub and README
4. **Rollback Ready**: Can revert to previous version in <2 minutes
5. **Documentation**: Clear deployment process documentation

---

## üîß Technical Approach

### Option 1: Netlify GitHub App (Recommended)
- Install Netlify GitHub App on repository
- Configure auto-deploy from main branch
- Set build command: `npm run build:web`  
- Set publish directory: `packages/web/dist`

### Option 2: GitHub Actions Deploy
- Use `netlify-cli` in GitHub Actions
- Deploy via API with authentication token
- More control but requires secret management

### Option 3: Webhook Trigger
- Configure Netlify build hook
- Trigger from GitHub Actions on success
- Simple but less integrated

## üìã Implementation Steps

1. **Connect Repository**
   - Link GitHub repo to Netlify site
   - Configure build settings
   - Test manual deploy

2. **Update CI Workflow**
   - Add deployment job after tests pass
   - Configure for main branch only
   - Add status notifications

3. **Validate Pipeline**
   - Make test commit to main
   - Verify deployment succeeds
   - Check production site updates

4. **Documentation**
   - Update README with badges
   - Document deployment process
   - Create troubleshooting guide

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

- **Risk:** Breaking production with bad deploy
  - **Mitigation:** Keep rollback process under 2 minutes
  
- **Risk:** Secret exposure in logs
  - **Mitigation:** Use Netlify's secret management, never echo secrets

- **Risk:** Build failures blocking development  
  - **Mitigation:** Separate deploy job from test job, allow manual override

---

## üìä Sprint Tracking

- [ ] GitHub-Netlify connection established
- [ ] Auto-deploy working on main branch push
- [ ] Build status badge added to README
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Rollback tested and documented
- [ ] Team documentation completed

---

## üéØ Definition of Done

- Push to main automatically deploys to Netlify
- Build status visible in GitHub UI
- Deployment completes in under 5 minutes
- Rollback procedure tested and documented
- No manual steps required for standard deployment
