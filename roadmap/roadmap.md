## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Sprint Pipeline

### **Sprint 2: Authentication & Session Management** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Duration:** 2025-08-12 ‚Üí 2025-08-14 (2 days)  
**Status:** Delivered production-ready authentication system  
**Details:** See `/roadmap/sprint-2-complete.md`

### **Sprint 3: Production Configuration & Finalization** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Duration:** 2025-08-15 (3 hours)  
**Status:** Successfully delivered production-ready extension  
**Details:** See `/roadmap/sprint-3-complete.md`

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Original planning failure revealed 90% of infrastructure already existed.
**ACTUAL SCOPE:** Configuration fixes only (3 files: extension URLs + web auth fix)

### **Sprint 4: Technical Patterns & React Foundation** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Duration:** 2025-08-16 (1 day)  
**Status:** React foundation established, patterns documented  
**Details:** See `/roadmap/SPRINT-4-MASTER-PLAN.md`

**Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ React 18.3.1 + TypeScript installed and configured
- ‚úÖ Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui integrated with 400+ design tokens
- ‚úÖ Component library created with migration bridge patterns
- ‚úÖ Build system enhanced (Vite + React + PostCSS)
- ‚úÖ Agent memory files updated with patterns

**Key Decision:** Maintain vanilla JS for current production, enable gradual React migration

### **Sprint 5: Next.js Migration** ‚ùå **CANCELLED - FAILURE**
**Duration:** 4 days (planned: 4 weeks)  
**Status:** Complete failure, implementation removed from codebase  
**Details:** See `/roadmap/SPRINT-5-FAILURE-REPORT.md`

**Failure Summary:**
- 122+ TypeScript errors indicating systemic issues
- Build system broken (PostCSS/Tailwind incompatibility)
- Missing infrastructure (Jest, ESLint, environment config)
- Quality gates bypassed leading to technical debt accumulation
- Foundation assumptions proved false upon validation

### **Sprint 6: Disciplined Next.js Migration - Clean Rewrite** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Duration:** 1 day (2025-08-18)  
**Status:** Successfully completed with working Next.js foundation  
**Details:** See `/roadmap/SPRINT-6-MASTER-PLAN.md` and `/roadmap/retrospectives/sprint6-retrospective.md`

**Strategy:**
- Vanilla `create-next-app` scaffold baseline + incremental adaptation
- Zero TypeScript error tolerance with "STOP THE LINE" quality gates
- One component at a time migration with daily validation
- Preserve 95/100 UX quality through disciplined approach
- Complete process redesign based on Sprint 5 failure analysis

### **Sprint 7: CI/CD Pipeline Excellence** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Duration:** 1 day (2025-08-20)  
**Status:** Successfully delivered with user-validated production parity  
**Details:** See `/roadmap/SPRINT-7.md`

**Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic Netlify deployment on every push to main branch
- ‚úÖ Next.js deployment configuration optimized for Netlify
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline operational  
- ‚úÖ Environment variable management (Clerk authentication)
- ‚úÖ Production parity validated (user confirmed: "I see in netlify the same thing I see in localhost")
- ‚úÖ 4-minute deployment cycle established

**Key Success:** User validation of complete production parity with localhost

## üìã Sprint Process & Guidelines

### **Team-Approved Sprint Requirements**

**Before Any Sprint Starts:**
1. **Tech Lead Review** - Architecture feasibility and technical approach
2. **Full-Stack Engineer Review** - Implementation planning and effort estimation  
3. **QA Engineer Review** - Testing strategy and acceptance criteria definition
4. **Project Lead Approval** - Final scope and timeline approval

**Sprint States:**
- `draft` - Initial planning, needs team review and approval
- `approved` - Team approved, ready to start execution
- `active` - Currently executing, all team members coordinated
- `complete` - Finished, tested, and properly closed

### **Sprint Scope Guidelines**

**Maximum Sprint Duration:** 3 days  
**Focus Principle:** Single objective per sprint  
**Quality Gate:** No sprint closes without QA validation

**Sprint Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- ‚ùå Multiple unrelated features in one sprint
- ‚ùå Starting sprints without full team design review
- ‚ùå Deployment + feature development in same sprint  
- ‚ùå Scope creep during execution
