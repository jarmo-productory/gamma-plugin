## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Sprint Pipeline

### **Sprint 2: Authentication & Session Management** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Duration:** 2025-08-12 ‚Üí 2025-08-14 (2 days)  
**Status:** Delivered production-ready authentication system  
**Details:** See `/roadmap/sprint-2-complete.md`

### **Sprint 3: Production Configuration & Finalization** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Duration:** 2025-08-15 (3 hours)  
**Status:** Successfully delivered production-ready extension  
**Details:** See `/roadmap/sprint-3-complete.md`

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Original planning failure revealed 90% of infrastructure already existed.
**ACTUAL SCOPE:** Configuration fixes only (3 files: extension URLs + web auth fix)

**Team Review Complete:**
- ‚úÖ **Tech Lead** - Architecture validated, configuration approach approved
- ‚úÖ **DevOps Engineer** - Infrastructure discovery revealed production system 100% operational  
- ‚úÖ **Full-Stack Engineer** - Exact implementation requirements identified (2-4 hours)
- ‚úÖ **QA Engineer** - Focused testing strategy for realistic scope
- ‚úÖ **UX/UI Engineer** - Production UX standards validated
- ‚úÖ **Project Lead** - Approved lean approach and realistic timeline

### **Sprint 4: Presentation Data Sync** ‚è≥ **PLANNED**
**Duration:** TBD (Est. 2-3 days)  
**Status:** Not yet designed

**Scope Preview:**
- `/api/presentations/save|get|list` endpoint implementation
- Extension sync integration when authenticated
- Cross-device timetable access
- Basic conflict resolution

### **Sprint 5: Web Dashboard Features** ‚è≥ **PLANNED**  
**Duration:** TBD (Est. 2-3 days)  
**Status:** Not yet designed

**Scope Preview:**
- Presentation management UI (list, view, edit)
- User profile and account settings

## üìã Sprint Process & Guidelines

### **Team-Approved Sprint Requirements**

**Before Any Sprint Starts:**
1. **Tech Lead Review** - Architecture feasibility and technical approach
2. **Full-Stack Engineer Review** - Implementation planning and effort estimation  
3. **QA Engineer Review** - Testing strategy and acceptance criteria definition
4. **Project Lead Approval** - Final scope and timeline approval

**Sprint States:**
- `draft` - Initial planning, needs team review and approval
- `approved` - Team approved, ready to start execution
- `active` - Currently executing, all team members coordinated
- `complete` - Finished, tested, and properly closed

### **Sprint Scope Guidelines**

**Maximum Sprint Duration:** 3 days  
**Focus Principle:** Single objective per sprint  
**Quality Gate:** No sprint closes without QA validation

**Sprint Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- ‚ùå Multiple unrelated features in one sprint
- ‚ùå Starting sprints without full team design review
- ‚ùå Deployment + feature development in same sprint  
- ‚ùå Scope creep during execution

## üéØ Current Focus

### **Immediate Priority: Sprint 3 Execution**

**Current Status:** 
Sprint 3 approved and ready for execution after comprehensive team discovery revealed actual scope.

**Key Discovery:** Original planning assumed need to create new infrastructure. Reality: production system 100% operational, only need configuration fixes.

**Next Action Required:**
Execute Sprint 3 configuration changes:
- Update extension URLs from localhost to production  
- Fix production web UI authentication loading issue
- Complete end-to-end production validation

**Success Criteria:**
- Extension communicates with production APIs
- Web dashboard functional at https://productory-powerups.netlify.app
- Complete authentication flow working in production
