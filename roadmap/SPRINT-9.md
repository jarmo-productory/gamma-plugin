# Sprint 9: Re-establish Extension-Web Authentication Pairing

**Sprint Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Sprint Status:** PLANNING  
**Primary Objective:** Re-establish device pairing authentication flow between Chrome extension sidebar and web application

---

## üéØ Sprint Goal

**Single Focus:** Fix and re-establish the authentication pairing mechanism that allows the Chrome extension to authenticate with the web application using device pairing flow.

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ User can initiate pairing from Chrome extension
- ‚úÖ Web app recognizes and processes pairing requests
- ‚úÖ Successful token exchange between extension and web
- ‚úÖ Persistent authentication state after pairing
- ‚úÖ Clear user feedback during pairing process

---

## üìã Current State Analysis

### What's Working:
- ‚úÖ Web app authentication via Clerk (user can sign in)
- ‚úÖ Extension has authentication UI elements (Login button in sidebar)
- ‚úÖ Device pairing infrastructure exists in codebase
- ‚úÖ API endpoints for device operations present

### What's Broken:
- ‚ùå Pairing flow not completing successfully
- ‚ùå Token exchange mechanism may be misconfigured
- ‚ùå Extension not properly storing authentication tokens
- ‚ùå Web app not recognizing device pairing codes

### Key Components to Review:
1. **Extension Side:**
   - `/packages/extension/sidebar/sidebar.js` - Login button handler
   - `/packages/shared/auth/device.ts` - Device authentication logic
   - `/packages/shared/auth/index.ts` - Auth manager

2. **Web Side:**
   - `/packages/web-next/src/hooks/useDevicePairing.ts` - Pairing hook
   - `/packages/web-next/src/app/api/auth/` - Auth API endpoints
   - `/packages/web-next/src/app/page.tsx` - Pairing UI components

3. **Shared:**
   - Configuration for API URLs
   - Token storage mechanisms
   - Message passing between components

## üîß Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Discovery & Diagnosis (2-3 hours)
1. **Test Current Flow:**
   - Click login in extension sidebar
   - Monitor network requests
   - Check console for errors
   - Verify API endpoint responses

2. **Trace Authentication Path:**
   - Extension ‚Üí Device registration
   - Web app ‚Üí Code recognition
   - Token exchange process
   - Storage and persistence

3. **Identify Failure Points:**
   - Where exactly does the flow break?
   - What error messages appear?
   - Are tokens being generated?
   - Is storage working correctly?

### Phase 2: Fix Implementation (3-4 hours)
Based on discovery findings, implement fixes for:
- API endpoint configuration
- Token exchange mechanism
- Storage persistence
- Error handling and recovery

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (2 hours)
1. **End-to-End Testing:**
   - Complete pairing flow multiple times
   - Test with fresh browser profile
   - Verify persistence across sessions
   - Test error recovery scenarios

2. **User Experience Validation:**
   - Clear feedback during pairing
   - Success/failure messages
   - Loading states
   - Retry mechanisms

## üöÄ Implementation Tasks

### Task List:
- [ ] Test current pairing flow and document failure points
- [ ] Review device authentication code in both extension and web
- [ ] Check API endpoint configuration and responses
- [ ] Fix token exchange mechanism
- [ ] Implement proper token storage in extension
- [ ] Add error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Test complete flow end-to-end
- [ ] Document working pairing process

### Priority Order:
1. **Critical:** Get basic pairing working (device code ‚Üí token)
2. **Important:** Persistence and session management
3. **Nice-to-have:** Enhanced error messages and retry logic

---

## üìä Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements:
- Device pairing completes without errors
- Authentication tokens properly stored
- Session persists across browser restarts
- Both extension and web recognize auth state

### Performance Requirements:
- Pairing completes within 30 seconds
- No unnecessary API calls
- Smooth user experience without freezes

### Quality Requirements:
- No console errors during pairing
- Clear user feedback at each step
- Graceful handling of edge cases

## üîç Key Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: CORS/Security Issues
**Mitigation:** Ensure proper CORS headers on API endpoints and verify origin checks

### Risk 2: Token Storage Limitations
**Mitigation:** Use appropriate Chrome extension storage APIs with proper permissions

### Risk 3: API Rate Limiting
**Mitigation:** Implement proper polling intervals and exponential backoff

### Risk 4: Stale Configuration
**Mitigation:** Verify all environment variables and API URLs are current

---

## üìù Notes & Context

### Previous Implementation:
The authentication system was working in earlier sprints but may have broken during:
- Sprint 8 production crisis resolution
- API key migrations
- Next.js migration work

### Key Dependencies:
- Clerk authentication service
- Supabase for data persistence
- Chrome Extension APIs for storage
- Web messaging APIs for communication

### User Flow:
1. User clicks "Login" in extension sidebar
2. Extension registers device and gets pairing code
3. Browser opens web app with pairing code
4. User signs in (if needed) on web app
5. Web app recognizes code and links device
6. Token sent back to extension
7. Extension stores token for future use
8. Success message shown to user

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

**Sprint is complete when:**
1. User can successfully pair extension with web app
2. Authentication persists across sessions
3. Both extension and web sync data after pairing
4. Clear documentation of working flow exists
5. No blocking errors in console

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Code reviewed and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Working in development environment
- [ ] User can complete full pairing flow
- [ ] Authentication state properly managed

---

## üéØ Sprint Outcome

**Expected Deliverable:** 
A fully functional authentication pairing system that reliably connects the Chrome extension with the web application, allowing users to sync their timetable data across devices.

**Post-Sprint Next Steps:**
Once authentication is re-established, future sprints can focus on:
- Enhanced data synchronization
- Real-time updates
- Collaborative features
- Security hardening
