## 🎯 Quick Start (for AI agents)

**Understanding the system architecture:**

1. **System Overview** → Start here for high-level architecture
2. **Component Design** → Individual component architectures
3. **Data Flow** → How data moves through the system
4. **Integration Points** → External service integrations

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

**Key architectural decisions:**

1. **Chrome Extension MV3** - Manifest V3 architecture
2. **Supabase Backend** - PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time
3. **React Components** - Component-based UI architecture
4. **TypeScript First** - Type-safe development
