# DevOps & Infrastructure Agent Memory

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-12T03:35:00Z  
**Agent Role:** Platform Operations & CI/CD

## 🎯 Current Infrastructure Focus

- **Production Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline for GitHub → Netlify → Chrome Web Store
- **Environment Management**: Production environment variables and security
- **Monitoring Setup**: Error tracking and performance monitoring
- **Database Operations**: Production migrations and backup strategy

## 📋 Recent Infrastructure Work

### Local Development Environment (Complete)
- ✅ **Netlify Dev**: Functions running on localhost:3000 with hot reload
- ✅ **Supabase Local**: Database and migrations working with CLI
- ✅ **Extension Dev**: Hot reload with Vite build system
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: All dev secrets configured and working

### Production Readiness Status
- 🔄 **Netlify Production**: Site linked but no production deployments yet
- 🔄 **Environment Variables**: Dev secrets set, production secrets needed
- 🔄 **CI/CD Pipeline**: Manual process, automated pipeline required
- 🔄 **Monitoring**: No error tracking or performance monitoring

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Architecture

### Current Stack
```yaml
Development:
  Extension: Chrome DevTools + Vite hot reload
  Web: Netlify Dev (localhost:3000) + Next.js
  Database: Supabase Local + CLI migrations
  Functions: 5 endpoints operational with JWT auth

Production (Ready):
  Extension: Manual build + Chrome Web Store upload
  Web: Netlify deployment with custom domain
  Database: Supabase hosted (dknqqcnnbcqujeffbmmb)  
  Functions: Auto-deploy from main branch
```

### Security & Secrets Management
- **Development**: Environment variables via Netlify dev
- **Production**: GitHub Secrets → Netlify environment variables
- **Database**: Supabase service role keys with RLS enforcement
- **Authentication**: Clerk production keys for hosted sign-in

## 🚨 Infrastructure Monitoring

### Current Gaps
- **Error Tracking**: No centralized error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket)
- **Performance Monitoring**: No API response time or database performance tracking
- **Uptime Monitoring**: No alerts for service outages
- **Security Scanning**: No automated vulnerability or dependency scanning

### Database Management
- **Backups**: Supabase automatic backups enabled
- **Migrations**: Version controlled with Supabase CLI
- **Performance**: No query performance monitoring yet
- **Scaling**: Single database instance, no read replicas

## 🔮 Infrastructure Roadmap

### Sprint 2 Priorities
1. **GitHub Actions**: Automated extension packaging and testing
2. **Production Deploy**: Netlify production environment with proper secrets
3. **Database Migration**: Production schema deployment pipeline
4. **Basic Monitoring**: Health checks and error alerting

### Future Infrastructure
- **CDN Optimization**: Static asset delivery and caching strategy
- **Load Testing**: API performance under high user load
- **Multi-Environment**: Staging environment for QA testing
- **Container Strategy**: Docker for consistent development environments

## 📝 Deployment Procedures

### Current Manual Process
```bash
# Extension Release
npm run build:extension
npm run package
# Manual Chrome Web Store upload

# Web Dashboard Release  
git push origin main
# Auto-deploys via Netlify GitHub integration

# Database Changes
supabase db push
# Manual migration application
```

### Target Automated Process
```yaml
GitHub Actions:
  - Extension: Build → Test → Package → Store Upload
  - Web: Build → Test → Deploy → Health Check  
  - Database: Migrate → Validate → Monitor
```

## 🔧 Operations Runbook

### Environment URLs
- **Local Dev**: http://localhost:3000 (web + functions)
- **Netlify Production**: TBD (needs custom domain)
- **Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dknqqcnnbcqujeffbmmb

### Emergency Procedures
- **Rollback**: Netlify dashboard → previous deployment
- **Database Recovery**: Supabase dashboard → restore from backup  
- **Extension Issues**: Chrome Web Store → unpublish if critical bug

### Monitoring Endpoints
- **Health Check**: GET /api/health (needs implementation)
- **Database Status**: Supabase dashboard metrics
- **Function Logs**: Netlify dashboard function logs
