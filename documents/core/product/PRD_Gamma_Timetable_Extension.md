# Product Requirements Document: Gamma Timetable Chrome Extension

## 1. Executive Summary

### Product Overview

The Gamma Timetable Chrome Extension is a browser add-on that automatically extracts slide content from Gamma presentations and generates structured timetables/schedules. This tool will help educators, trainers, and presenters plan their sessions by automatically creating time-based schedules from their slide decks.

### Value Proposition

- **Time-saving**: Automatically generates timetables from existing presentations.
- **Cloud-Enabled**: Securely sync your timetables across multiple devices.
- **Accessible**: Access and manage your presentations from anywhere via a web dashboard.
- **Flexible**: Allows manual adjustment of timing and content.
- **Integrated**: Works directly within the Gamma web interface.
- **Exportable**: Provides multiple export formats for easy sharing.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1.  **Manual Process**: Creating timetables from presentations requires manual copying and time estimation.
2.  **Data Silos**: Timetables created on one computer are not accessible on another.
3.  **Lack of Persistence**: Reinstalling the browser or extension can lead to data loss.
4.  **Format Conversion**: No easy way to convert presentation structure into a timetable format.

### Target Users

- **Primary**: Educators and trainers using Gamma for course creation who work across multiple devices.
- **Secondary**: Business presenters and workshop facilitators who need to access their materials on the go.
- **Tertiary**: Teams who may need to collaborate on presentation timings in the future.

## 3. Product Goals
