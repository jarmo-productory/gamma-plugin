3. **Settings** - Simple notification preferences

### **Information Architecture**
```
Account Settings
├── Profile
│   ├── Name (editable)
│   ├── Email (display only)
│   └── Registration Date
├── Security
│   ├── Change Password
│   └── Email Notifications (on/off)
```

### **Mobile-First Considerations**
