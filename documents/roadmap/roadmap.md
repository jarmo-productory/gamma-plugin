**Key Decision:** Maintain vanilla JS for current production, enable gradual React migration

### **Sprint 5: Next.js Migration** ❌ **CANCELLED - FAILURE**
**Duration:** 4 days (planned: 4 weeks)  
**Status:** Complete failure, implementation removed from codebase  
**Details:** See `/roadmap/SPRINT-5-FAILURE-REPORT.md`

**Failure Summary:**
- 122+ TypeScript errors indicating systemic issues
- Build system broken (PostCSS/Tailwind incompatibility)
- Missing infrastructure (Jest, ESLint, environment config)
- Quality gates bypassed leading to technical debt accumulation
- Foundation assumptions proved false upon validation

### **Sprint 6: Disciplined Next.js Migration - Clean Rewrite** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Duration:** 1 day (2025-08-18)  
**Status:** Successfully completed with working Next.js foundation  
**Details:** See `/roadmap/SPRINT-6-MASTER-PLAN.md` and `/roadmap/retrospectives/sprint6-retrospective.md`

**Strategy:**
- Vanilla `create-next-app` scaffold baseline + incremental adaptation
- Zero TypeScript error tolerance with "STOP THE LINE" quality gates
- One component at a time migration with daily validation
- Preserve 95/100 UX quality through disciplined approach
- Complete process redesign based on Sprint 5 failure analysis

### **Sprint 7: CI/CD Pipeline Excellence** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Duration:** 1 day (2025-08-20)  
**Status:** Successfully delivered with user-validated production parity  
**Details:** See `/roadmap/SPRINT-7.md`

**Achievements:**

- ✅ Next.js deployment configuration optimized for Netlify
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline operational  
- ✅ Environment variable management (Clerk authentication)
- ✅ Production parity validated (user confirmed: "I see in netlify the same thing I see in localhost")
- ✅ 4-minute deployment cycle established

**Key Success:** User validation of complete production parity with localhost

### **Sprint 8: Production Crisis Resolution** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Duration:** 3 days (2025-08-20 → 2025-08-23)  
**Status:** Successfully pivoted from planned security work to production emergency  
**Details:** See `/roadmap/SPRINT-8-MASTER-PLAN.md` and `/roadmap/retrospectives/sprint8-retrospective.md`

**Critical Achievements:**
- ✅ **Production Restored**: HTTP 500 errors → HTTP 200 operational status
- ✅ **API Key Migration**: Successfully migrated from legacy to new Supabase/Clerk keys
- ✅ **CI/CD Simplified**: Removed GitHub Actions, implemented direct Netlify auto-deploy (1-2 min vs 4+ min)
- ✅ **Build Issues Resolved**: Fixed lightningcss dependency and Next.js configuration
- ✅ **User Satisfaction**: Production parity maintained with simplified workflow

**Key Success:** Rapid production crisis resolution with improved deployment process

**Note:** Original security hardening scope postponed for production stability priority

### **Sprint 9-18: Authentication & Infrastructure** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Combined Status:** Series of sprints completed, various infrastructure improvements

## 📋 Sprint Process & Guidelines

### **Team-Approved Sprint Requirements**

**Before Any Sprint Starts:**
1. **Tech Lead Review** - Architecture feasibility and technical approach
2. **Full-Stack Engineer Review** - Implementation planning and effort estimation  
3. **QA Engineer Review** - Testing strategy and acceptance criteria definition
4. **Project Lead Approval** - Final scope and timeline approval

**Sprint States:**
- `draft` - Initial planning, needs team review and approval
- `approved` - Team approved, ready to start execution
- `active` - Currently executing, all team members coordinated
- `complete` - Finished, tested, and properly closed

### **Sprint Scope Guidelines**

**Maximum Sprint Duration:** 3 days  
**Focus Principle:** Single objective per sprint  
**Quality Gate:** No sprint closes without QA validation

**Sprint Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- ❌ Multiple unrelated features in one sprint
- ❌ Starting sprints without full team design review
- ❌ Deployment + feature development in same sprint  
- ❌ Scope creep during execution

### Sprint 23: Internal/Admin APIs Hardening ✅ COMPLETE
**Duration:** 2025-08-31 → 2025-09-01  
**Status:** Security hardening delivered and validated  
**Details:** See `documents/roadmap/SPRINT-23-INTERNAL-APIS-HARDENING.md`

**Key Outcomes:**
- Internal guard utility (`requireInternalAccess`, `requireAdminAccess`) with 404‑by‑default posture.
- Middleware blocks legacy `/api/(debug|test-*|migrate)` when disabled.
- Internal diagnostics relocated to `/api/_internal/*` and gated by token.
- Admin service‑role usage isolated to `POST /api/admin/tokens/cleanup`.
- Minimal public health endpoint `/api/health`.
- CI/build guardrails to block regressions.

**Environment Guidance:**
- Staging: `ENABLE_INTERNAL_APIS=true` with `INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` set.
- Production: `ENABLE_INTERNAL_APIS=false` (default); enable temporarily only for incident response.

### Sprint 26: Presentations Save Flow Fix 📝 PLANNED
**Duration:** 1–2 days  
**Status:** Planning approved → ready to start  
**Details:** See `documents/roadmap/SPRINT-26-PRESENTATIONS-SAVE-FLOW-FIX.md`

**Objective:**
Unblock extension saves and reads by aligning payload contracts and adding SECURITY DEFINER RPCs for device-token paths (no service-role in user routes).

**Key Deliverables:**
- Extension payload uses `gamma_url`, `timetable_data`, `start_time`, `total_duration`.
- Server accepts camelCase and snake_case during transition; zod validation.
- RPC `upsert_presentation_from_device` implemented; save route calls RPC for device-token.
- GET/LIST/[id] use RPC-backed reads for device-token with anon client.

**Acceptance:**
- Save returns 200 and upserts by `(user_id, gamma_url)`; reads return only user's rows; RLS respected.

### Sprint 30: Single Timetable View 📋 PLANNING
**Status:** Ready for AI implementation  
**Details:** See `documents/roadmap/SPRINT-30-SINGLE-TIMETABLE-VIEW.md`
**Related Audit:** `documents/audits/single-timetable-view-expansion-audit.md`

**Mission:**
Transform timetables overview into a powerful, presenter-focused experience with dedicated single timetable views. Provide the same core functionality as the sidebar but in a more powerful, full-featured format.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Dedicated `/gamma/timetables/[id]` route with comprehensive single presentation view
- Enhanced timeline visualization and interactive slide management
- Professional export capabilities (CSV/XLSX) with improved formatting
- Time editing functionality (start time, slide durations) with live preview
- Mobile-responsive design maintaining existing UI/UX standards

**Technical Approach:**
- Leverage existing database schema (no migrations required)
- Reuse 80%+ of existing components and API endpoints
- Build on Sofia Sans typography and established design system
- Maintain all existing security and authentication patterns

**Success Criteria:**
- Seamless navigation from timetables grid to detailed single view
- Optimized performance for typical presentations
- Full mobile responsiveness with touch-friendly controls
- Professional presentation preparation and delivery experience

**Implementation Phases:**
- Phase 1: Route structure and core components
- Phase 2: Interactive features and enhanced exports
- Phase 3: Polish and responsive design
- Phase 4: Validation and testing

**Risk Assessment:** LOW - High code reuse, no database changes, clear implementation path
