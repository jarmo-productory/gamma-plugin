  📍 CI/CD: Direct Netlify integration (4-minute deploy cycle from git push)

  ✅ Phase 2: Database Integration (Week 2) - COMPLETED 2025-08-24

  ✅ 2.1: Set up Supabase project (hosted) - Remote database configured
  ✅ 2.2: Add Supabase client to Next.js - Environment variables configured
  ✅ 2.3: Configure localhost → remote database connection
  ✅ 2.4: Test database connection - API endpoint validation successful
  ✅ 2.5: Resolve Supabase API key format migration (legacy → publishable keys)
  
  📍 STATUS: Localhost development now connects to remote Supabase production database
  📍 DATABASE: https://dknqqcnnbcqujeffbmmb.supabase.co (production-ready)
  📍 TESTING: /api/test-db endpoint confirms successful connection

  ✅ Phase 3: Authentication (Week 3) - COMPLETED 2025-08-24

  ✅ 3.1: PKCE auth clients setup (server, client, middleware) - Enhanced security vs implicit grant
  ✅ 3.2: Functional email/password + Google OAuth - Professional UX with loading states
  ✅ 3.3: Google Cloud Console OAuth setup - Consent screen configured, credentials working
  ✅ 3.4: Authentication callback + dashboard - Protected routes with user session management
  ✅ 3.5: Complete auth flow testing - Google OAuth functional, database integration confirmed
  ✅ 3.6: Email authentication debugging - Root cause identified and UX improvements implemented

  📍 STATUS: Authentication system production-ready with Supabase + Google OAuth + Email/Password
  📍 TESTING: Google OAuth ✅, Email auth ✅ (with proper confirmation flow), Dashboard operational ✅
  📍 SECURITY: PKCE flow, server-side sessions, protected routes, email confirmation all functional
  📍 UX: Professional tabbed interface, user-friendly error messages, loading states implemented

  📋 Phase 4: Extension-Web App Integration (Week 4) - IN PROGRESS

  📋 4.1: Enhanced Device Pairing Flow - Extension → Web App Authentication
  ⏳ 4.1.1: Create dedicated pairing route (/pair) in web app
  ⏳ 4.1.2: Implement pairing token generation and validation system  
  ⏳ 4.1.3: Add "Sign in" button in extension that opens web app pairing page
  ⏳ 4.1.4: Create "Pair Device" UI in web app (works with any auth method)
  ⏳ 4.1.5: Extension receives pairing token and stores for API calls
  
  📋 4.2: Presentation Data Sync
  ⏳ 4.2.1: API endpoints for presentation CRUD operations
  ⏳ 4.2.2: Extension integration to sync presentation data
  ⏳ 4.2.3: Dashboard presentation management UI

  📍 STRATEGY: Device pairing approach - supports any authentication method (Google, email, future providers)
  📍 UX FLOW: Extension "Sign in" → Web app /pair → Authenticate if needed → Click "Pair" → Close window → Done
  📍 BENEFIT: Works with email/password, Google OAuth, or any future auth providers seamlessly

  ✅ Phase 2.5: Quality Assurance & Testing Infrastructure - COMPLETED 2025-08-24

  ✅ 2.5.1: Fix ESLint Next.js plugin configuration - .eslintrc.json created with Next.js rules
  ✅ 2.5.2: Resolve multiple lockfile warning - packages/web/package-lock.json removed
  ✅ 2.5.3: Fix missing pre-build-gates.sh script - Created executable script for Playwright
  ✅ 2.5.4: Set up Vitest unit testing for web package - Button component tests working (4/4 passed)
  ✅ 2.5.5: Configure Playwright E2E tests for authentication flow - E2E suite operational (19/22 passed)

  📍 QUALITY STATUS: Testing infrastructure ✅, ESLint with Next.js rules ✅, Unit tests ✅, E2E tests ✅
  📍 E2E FINDINGS: Authentication system operational - homepage has embedded login/signup tabs, dashboard protection working
  📍 TESTING: Vitest unit tests (4/4 passed), Playwright E2E (19/22 passed) - comprehensive auth analysis complete
  📍 AUTH STATUS: Tab-based UI ✅, Google OAuth detected ✅, Dashboard redirects ✅, Form validation ✅
