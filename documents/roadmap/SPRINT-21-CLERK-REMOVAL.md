# Sprint 21: Clerk Authentication Removal & Supabase Standardization

**Sprint Number:** 21  
**Duration:** 3 days (2025-08-31 ‚Üí 2025-09-03)  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Priority:** HIGH - Security & Architecture Cleanliness  

**Lead:** Team Orchestrator  
**Team:** Tech Lead, Full-Stack Engineer, QA Engineer, DevOps Engineer

---

## üéØ Primary Objective

**Remove all Clerk authentication traces from the codebase and standardize on Supabase Auth exclusively.**

Based on comprehensive audit findings, eliminate 100% of Clerk dependencies to prevent security vulnerabilities, reduce complexity, and establish clean authentication architecture with Supabase as the single source of truth.

---

## üìã Sprint Context

### **Why This Sprint**
- **Security Risk**: Dual authentication systems create attack vectors and complexity
- **Architecture Debt**: Mixed Clerk/Supabase patterns cause developer confusion  
- **Maintenance Burden**: Two auth systems require duplicate security updates
- **Build Complexity**: Clerk dependencies add unnecessary bundle size and build time
- **Foundation Requirement**: Clean auth architecture needed for advanced features

### **Sprint 19-20 Status**
- Sprint 19: Database Excellence (PLANNING ‚Üí needs Sprint 21 completion first)
- Sprint 20: Account Management (BLOCKED ‚Üí depends on clean auth system)

### **Validated Audit Scope**
- **250+ Clerk references** across 45+ files requiring systematic removal
- **Build-breaking dependencies** in 19+ files requiring immediate attention
- **Database schema migration** required for RLS policy updates
- **Documentation cleanup** needed across architecture and agent guidance

---

## üöÄ Phase-Based Execution Strategy

### **Phase 1: Code & Dependencies (Build-Critical) - Day 1**
**Owner:** Full-Stack Engineer  
**Duration:** 6-8 hours  
**Priority:** HIGHEST - Blocks all development

#### **Scope:**
- Remove `@clerk/clerk-js` imports and usage from `packages/shared/auth/index.ts`
- Migrate to Supabase Auth with device token flow compatibility
- Remove `__HAS_CLERK_KEY__` references and logging
- Delete backup files: `*.backup` from repository
- Update package.json dependencies and regenerate lockfiles
- Verify all builds pass: `shared`, `web`, `extension`

#### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Zero `@clerk` imports in codebase
- [ ] All builds pass without Clerk dependencies
- [ ] AuthManager maintains API compatibility with Supabase-only implementation
- [ ] Device auth flow continues to function
- [ ] No build-time or runtime Clerk references

#### **Risk Mitigation:**
- Preserve AuthManager interface to minimize breaking changes
- Maintain device authentication flow (already Supabase-compatible)
- Create rollback branch before starting changes

---

### **Phase 2: Environment & CI/CD (Infrastructure) - Day 2 Morning**
**Owner:** DevOps Engineer  
**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Priority:** HIGH - Prevents accidental reintroduction

#### **Scope:**
- Remove Clerk keys from `.env.example` and environment documentation
- Update GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to remove Clerk secrets
- Remove `__HAS_CLERK_KEY__` global from `eslint.config.js`
- Clean test setup files of Clerk environment variables
- Update Netlify configuration to remove Clerk references
- Implement CI guardrails to prevent Clerk reintroduction
- Update agent guidance files explicitly: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `claude-instruction-dump.md`, `GEMINI.md` (remove Clerk references; add ‚ÄúDo not introduce Clerk‚Äù guidance)

#### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] CI runs without Clerk secrets or dependencies
- [ ] Environment templates contain only Supabase configurations
- [ ] ESLint enforces no-Clerk-imports rule
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks scan for Clerk patterns
- [ ] Test suite passes with Supabase-only mocks
- [ ] GitHub and Netlify Clerk secrets removed/rotated

#### **Guardrails Implementation:**
```yaml
# CI Grep Gate
- name: "Block Clerk Dependencies"
  run: |
    if grep -R "@clerk\\|CLERK_\\|ClerkProvider\\|clerk_id\\|auth.third_party.clerk" --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git .; then
      echo "ERROR: Clerk dependencies detected"
      exit 1
    fi

# Optional: Block Clerk mentions in docs except archived paths
- name: "Docs Scan (non-archive)"
  run: |
    if rg -n "\\bClerk\\b" documents | rg -v "/archive/"; then
      echo "WARNING: 'Clerk' found in non-archive docs. Please remove or archive."
      exit 1
    fi
```

---

### **Phase 3: Database Migration (Data Layer) - Day 2 Afternoon**
**Owner:** Tech Lead + Full-Stack Engineer  
**Duration:** 4-5 hours  
**Priority:** HIGH - Database integrity

#### **Scope:**
- Create migration to remove `clerk_id` column from users table
- Update RLS policies to use `auth.uid()` directly with `users.id`
- Remove `[auth.third_party.clerk]` from `supabase/config.toml`
- Test data migration in staging environment
- Validate RLS policies with Supabase Auth sessions

#### **Migration Strategy (Two-Step for Safety):**
```sql
-- Step A: add new policies using Supabase user id directly (keep clerk_id temporarily)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own data" ON users;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own data" ON users
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own data" ON users;
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own data" ON users
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Update presentations policies similarly to check user_id = auth.uid()
-- (ensure users.id is uuid and matches Supabase auth.uid())

-- Step B (post-deploy verification complete): drop legacy Clerk linkage
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS clerk_id;
```

#### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Database migration applies successfully in staging
- [ ] RLS policies work with Supabase Auth sessions
- [ ] No references to `clerk_id` remain in schema
- [ ] Data integrity maintained through migration
- [ ] API routes function with updated auth patterns

---

### **Phase 4: Documentation & Agent Guidance (Knowledge) - Day 3**
**Owner:** UX/UI Engineer + QA Engineer  
**Duration:** 4-6 hours  
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Knowledge base cleanup

#### **Scope:**
- Update core architecture documents to reflect Supabase-only auth
- Clean Clerk references from 45+ documentation files
- Update agent guidance files: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `claude-instruction-dump.md`, `GEMINI.md` to prevent Clerk usage
- Create migration notes for historical context
- Archive legacy Clerk documentation with clear supersession notices

#### **Documentation Updates:**
- `documents/core/technical/database-architecture.md` ‚Üí "Authentication: Supabase Auth only"
- `documents/core/product/Development_Brief.md` ‚Üí Remove Clerk tech stack references
- `documents/core/environment-setup.md` ‚Üí Remove Clerk envs and setup
- `documents/core/technical/local-development-guide.md` ‚Üí Remove Clerk references
- Agent memory files ‚Üí Add "DO NOT use Clerk" guidance
- Roadmap documents ‚Üí Mark Clerk references as historical

#### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Core docs explicitly state "Supabase Auth only"
- [ ] Agent guidance prevents Clerk reintroduction
- [ ] Historical context preserved with clear supersession notes
- [ ] New developer onboarding reflects clean architecture
- [ ] Documentation CI checks prevent Clerk reference reintroduction
