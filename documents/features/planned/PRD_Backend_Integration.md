## 4. Technical Implementation Summary

The project will be built as a **single, unified Next.js application**. This single codebase will be statically exported to create two distinct clients:
1.  A full-featured **Web Dashboard** deployed to **Netlify**.
2.  A lightweight **Chrome Extension** distributed via the Chrome Web Store.

This modern approach ensures maximum code reuse and a streamlined development process. All backend functionality, including database storage and user authentication, will be handled by specialized third-party services, **Supabase** and **Clerk**, respectively. The Next.js application will be a pure client that communicates directly with these services.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 User Authentication (Leveraging Clerk)
- **Centralized Sign-Up**: New user registration will occur exclusively through the Web Dashboard to streamline the onboarding process.
- **Effortless Sign-In**: Users can log in directly from either the Chrome Extension or the Web Dashboard.
- **Guided Onboarding**: The Chrome Extension will guide new users to the Web Dashboard for account creation via a direct link.
- **Unified Session**: A user logged into one client (web or extension) will be automatically authenticated on the other within the same browser, creating a seamless experience powered by Clerk.

### 5.2 Data Synchronization (Leveraging Supabase)
- **Direct API Communication**: The application (both web and extension clients) will communicate directly with the **Supabase** backend using the official Supabase JS client library.
- **Data Persistence**: All user data, such as presentation timings, will be stored in a secure **PostgreSQL** database managed by Supabase.
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Data access will be secured using Supabase's RLS policies, ensuring users can only access their own data.
- **Offline Support**: The extension will implement a local caching and queueing mechanism to handle offline data changes, which will be synced with Supabase upon reconnection.
