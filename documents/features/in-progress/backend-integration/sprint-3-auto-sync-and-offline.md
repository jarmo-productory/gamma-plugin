# Sprint 3: Automatic Synchronization & Offline Support

- **Goal:** Implement a robust, automatic synchronization system within the Chrome Extension views of our unified app, leveraging modern browser technologies.
- **Deliverables:**
  1.  **Service Worker Setup:**
      - Implement a service worker for the extension to handle background tasks.
      - This will be the core of our sync engine, capable of running even when the popup is closed.
  2.  **Offline Data Queue:**
      - Utilize IndexedDB to create a reliable local queue for any data changes (create, update, delete) made while the user is offline.
  3.  **Sync Manager Logic:**
      - Create a `SyncManager` class or module that contains the logic to:
        - Check for network connectivity.
        - Process the offline queue, sending pending changes to Supabase when online.
        - Handle potential conflicts (e.g., using a "last-write-wins" strategy based on timestamps).
  4.  **Real-time Updates (Optional but Recommended):**
      - Leverage Supabase's real-time capabilities to listen for database changes.
      - When a change is detected (e.g., from a modification made on the web dashboard), the extension can automatically fetch the latest data, keeping all clients in sync.
  5.  **Sync Status UI:**
      - Add a subtle indicator to the extension's UI to show the current sync status (e.g., "Synced", "Syncing...", "Offline").
